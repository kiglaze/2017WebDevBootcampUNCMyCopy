# Phase 02 - Begin Logic

## Phase II Objectives

* For the next 25 minutes, your goals should be to:

  * Begin creating sets of variables that you think you will need. As a few suggestions:

    * firstNumber, secondNumber, operator, result

  * Create code that captures the numbers from button clicks, and then displays them on the HTML.

  * Create code that captures an operator click, then immediately tells your code to begin recording the second number. (Example: If a user hits the "plus" button, you know they are done typing the first number).

  * Create code that checks which operator the user has clicked, then saves this operator for later use in a conditional statement. (Example: If a user hits the "plus" button, you know you will need to be adding two numbers. If a user hits the "minus" button, you will need to be subtracting two numbers. Think: If-Then statements!)
