# Phase 01 - Getting Situated + Pseudocoding Stage

## Phase I Objectives

* For this first 15 minutes, your goals should be to:

  * Become familiar with the various elements of the HTML page as it is written now. (Identify the classes and IDs that matter!)

  * Create a general strategy for how you will accomplish the task:

    * How will you capture button clicks?
    * What will you do with the numbers clicked?
    * What will you do when the operator is clicked?
    * How will you differentiate numbers from operators?
    * How will you know the "value" of a number clicked?
    * How will you know when a user is done entering the first number?
    * Etc.

  * Create a few test "on-click" events. These could just trigger Alert messages for now. If you get further along, then have these buttons alert their "value".
