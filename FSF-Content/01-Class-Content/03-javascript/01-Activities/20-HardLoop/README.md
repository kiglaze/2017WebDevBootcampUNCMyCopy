### Instructions

* Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:

```
var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
```

* Then using the .charAt() method (research it) check if the first letter in the animal’s name begins with a “c” or “o”. If it does, create an alert saying: “Starts with c or an o!”
